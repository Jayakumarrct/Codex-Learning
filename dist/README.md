# Image2EPS Installer

Run `./scripts/pkg.sh` to generate `Image2EPS.pkg` and `SHA256.txt` in this directory. After building, run the installer to place the app in `/Applications`.

Usage:
1. Upload Images – select JPEG or PNG files.
2. Choose Output Folder – destination for converted EPS files.
3. Convert to EPS – converts the queued images.
4. Clear List – removes all items.

The app writes raster data into EPS files; vectorization is not performed. Grant file permissions via the open/save panels when prompted.
